### Basic Conditionals
---

Answer each of the the following questions in a separate JavaScript file named `hw3-2-#.js` where `#` is the number of the question. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file. Be sure to write the program in a way that allows you to swap values to make the program more versatile.


1. In order to make the jump in a racing game, the player's speed needs to be above 80 mph. Write a program that checks if a predefined variable for speed is above the threshold for them to successfully make the jump. If their speed is fast enough to make the jump, display a message indicating that they were successful. If their speed is not fast enough to make the jump, display a message indicating that they were not successful. Be sure to use if and/or if-else statements.

2. A knight is fighting the dragon which is the final boss of a dungeon. In order to beat the dragon, the knight must have an attack higher than the dragon's defense. Write a program that compares two variables, one for the dragon's defense, and another for the knight's attack. If the knight's attack is above the dragon's defense, display a success message, otherwise, display a failure message.

3. A user is trying to set a password for their account in a new MMO game. The password must be longer than 8 characters. Write a program that checks the user's password is longer than the required 8 character minimum. If the password is long enough, display a message to the user stating that their password is strong. If the password is not longer than 8 characters, display a message to the user stating that their password is weak.
